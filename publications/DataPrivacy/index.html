    <h6>Posted on: 02 Aug, 2022</h6>
    <img src="/img/dataP.webp" style="max-height:300px;max-width:30%;" align="right" HSPACE="20">
    <p align="justify">Data is the oil of the 21st century. Consumer data has become a valuable asset for
      businesses, especially for technology firms that involve, the processing of terabytes of data
      regularly. With the increase in computers, smartphones, smartwatches, cars, social media,
      and, IoT-based devices, data is collected, stored, and processed every second via internet.
      Data can be classified into structured and unstructured data, both forms of data are primitive
      in the business decision process. This helps organizations to understand users’ tastes and
      preferences so they can provide a curated experience back to users. Since the last decade,
      there have been major concerns for users regarding how organizations might use their
      personal data. Many renowned companies indulged in tampering with users’ data for
      profits. For these issues, many regulations and policies have been taken by the governments
      at the national and international levels. This study navigates through the abnormal
      consequences that might arise from unethical activities performed by organizations in
      mishandling consumers’ data. Also helps to understand the right ethical data practices to
      be followed when collecting, maintaining, using, and sharing users’ sensitive data.</p>
    
    
    <p align="justify"><h3>What is Data privacy?</h3>
      Data privacy is the part of data management that deals with taking care of personal data in
      consistence with data protection laws, guidelines, and general privacy best practices.</p> 
    
    <p align="justify"><h3>Data and privacy in brief</h3>
      Data is the collection of information, statistics, facts, or figures. Personal data is nothing
      but what is related to an individual living being who can be identified from that data. The
      concept of data privacy existed some time before the information and technology sector
      growth. Personal data includes various kinds of information i.e. Health records, Sensitive
      data, Generic information, Subscriptions, Financial activities, Religious beliefs, Political
      Opinions, Mobile apps, Mobile Phone GPS, and other biometric data. Collecting these
      kinds of data is a well-known practice in today’s applications, forms, websites, and
      operating systems as they help companies with a plethora of information to serve the
      tailored content to consumers, performing business analysis and research & academics
      purposes in the organization.
      </p> 
      
    <p align="justify">Users’ data can be classified into three major groups, namely: Explicit data, implicit data,
      and, Third-party data.
      Explicit data means the data that is directly given by the user, which includes preferences,
      ID’s such as name, email, social accounts, social media posts, contents, billing address, and
      much more. This explicit data can be gathered by social media applications, surveys,
      payment portals, shopping platforms, and more. The second group of data is not provided
      directly by users but collected by companies performing analysis and unconsciously
      gathering information prior to users’ consent. This includes product functioning, session
      duration, web activities, location, logs created by system software, and usage activities,
      especially on smartphones. And at last, the third group consists of information obtained from external parties. This may contain implicit or explicit data or even both, but the data
      is filtered and offered access by the primary organization.
      With an ample amount of benefits of collecting personal data, it is crucial to be known
      about some of the risks and complications involved in using this information. Privacy is
      the ability to restrict or deny admittance to one’s data. It is very important for organizations
      to value customers’/users sensitive data. Users have concerns related to their personal data
      collection specifically for sensitive data, like medical, financial & digital data. While some
      may not have any issues with certain kinds of data collection, they may be comfortable in
      sharing their preferences and desire to enhance the recommendations. Some companies
      trade or allow access to use the data collected from users to generate revenue. Data sharing
      and utilization beyond the agreement is viewed as a privacy infringement. Proper data
      management and security involve five vital approaches, the use of the latest and encrypted
      technology, guidelines and rules for maintaining data, governance and monitoring, welldefined structure, and, procedures for maintenance and sharing of data elements. The data
      controller is the one responsible for the maintenance and governance of personal data. It’s
      important to understand the legal charges and abide by the union and federal laws.</p> 
      
    <p align="justify"><h3>Business involved in Data sharing:</h3>
      Data and analytics developers who share data extrinsically generate 3 times more
      quantifiable economic benefits than those who don’t. According to the latest Gartner’s
      chief data officer survey, sharing of data is the key performance indicator of
      accomplishing powerful partner commitment and giving venture esteem. ‘B2B data
      sharing’ is the pivotal strategy followed by many organizations in the 21st century.
      Organizations that engage in B2B data sharing need not provide complete access to their
      data inventory, only specified datasets can be shared depending on business goals. There
      are various nosiness models commanding ‘B2B data sharing’:
       Data Monetization: one-sided approach under which organizations make extra
      revenue from the information they share with other organizations. Data can also
      be monetized through the amenities of services.
       Data Marketplace: trusted intermediaries that bring data providers and data users
      together to trade in a secured online platform.
       Industrial Data Platforms: a cooperative and strategic way to deal with the
      exchange of data among a restricted set of organizations.
       Open Data Policy: organizations that pick to share information for free to
      cultivate the development and analysis of new products and/or services.
       Technical Enablers: Business organizations that are specifically dedicated to
      enabling data sharing through a specialized technical arrangement. Revenues are
      acquired from setting up, utilizing, and additionally keeping up with the
      arrangement.</p>

    <p align="justify"><h3>Government of India bans Chinese apps that present danger to
      national safety.</h3>
      In June 2020, the Govt. of India decided to ban around 224 Chinese apps from both the
      play store and the apple store, including famous applications like Shareit, WeChat, UC
      browsers, TikTok, Pubg mobile, CamScanner, Mi apps, ES file explorer and more. As
      per the Ministry of Electronics and information technology, the apps have been known to either run malicious programs or straightforwardly send users’ data to Chinese Data
      centers without users’ assent. Many of these applications could do reconnaissance and
      observation exercises through "camera/mic, getting to location data (GPS) and do
      malicious activities. Center stated that the transition to boycott the applications will
      defend the interests of crores of Indian versatile and internet users, the assertion said,
      adding the choice is a designated move to ensure digital wellbeing, security, and
      sovereignty of Indian cyberspace. After a month, some mirror applications were
      brought down as they were working regardless of the ban. As they were collecting the
      most sensitive data such as shopping habits, whereabouts, wellbeing records, social
      media interactions, texts, and voice chats of the individuals' network of friends, family,
      and associates.</p> 
      <p><h5 style="color: #bd5d38;">Highlights:</h5> India was one of the key application markets which was growing
      exponentially well because of low-cost internet services and was a big user base for
      Chinese tech firms. This ban affected china’s trade relations with India and its
      ambitious goal of being the ‘Digital superpower of the 21st century’.</p>

    <p align="justify"><h3>Facebook & Cambridge Analytica Scandal.</h3></p>
      <img src="/img/FacebookScandal.png" style="max-height:550px;max-width:80%;" align="right"  HSPACE="140">
      <p align="justify">
      Facebook, one of the world’s largest social media tech giants designed with the goal of
      connecting humans virtually was involved in a data infringement scandal in March
      2018. Facebook was extremely popular by 2018 with about 2.2 billion active monthly
      users yet the organization's consistent development was defaced by security concerns.
      Security concerns for Facebook began a long back. Particularly when Facebook
      launched ‘Open Graph’ API platforms for third-party apps in early 2010. This feature
      helped external organizations/developers to pull Facebook users’ data and their friends’
      data with their single permission. By this, they were able to access personal information
      like name, sex, location, D.O.B, education, political views, relationship status, religion,
      text messages, and uploaded media. This was the biggest loophole Facebook failed to
      understand. In 2018, Facebook was trapped in a significant data breach in which political consulting
      agency ‘Cambridge Analytica’, drew the sensitive data of more than 87+ million
      Facebook users without their assent. They used this data with the prime motive of the
      U.S Presidential campaign, Donald Trump, in the course of the 2016 election. Also, it
      was found that the information was mishandled to influence the Brexit referendum
      results in the favor of the Vote Leave campaign. The organization’s response to the
      scandal was reportedly graceless, defensive, and disoriented. When Facebook learned
      all about the data breach, it supposedly remained idle and deferred for many months to
      send notice to Cambridge Analytica to wipe all the data collected. Further, the
      organization didn't follow up to check whether the illicitly procured information had
      been wiped out. The scandal put Facebook experiencing the same thing where it was
      left confronting the wrath of millions of Facebook clients, lawmakers, and sponsors.
      Further, the organization's share value likewise dropped soon after the news of the data
      breach came to light. There were several challenges coming up for Facebook, including
      hate speech and negative campaigns running against it, and claims petitioned for the
      break of users’ privacy protection. Plus Facebook was fined $ 643,000 by UK’s
      Information commissioner’s office in October 2018. Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg
      apologized for the significant ‘breach of trust’ but it was totally not up to the chaos that
      happened.</p>
      <p><h5 style="color:#bd5d38">Highlights:</h5> As observed by an online survey across America, few Americans trusted
      Facebook more than other tech giants. Though the company took multiple initiatives
      and, policies to ward off such data leakages in the future, it lost its reputation among it's
      user base, there was definitely an erosion of trust. </p>

    <p align="justify"><h3>Data privacy measures to be considered by an organization:</h3></p>
    <p align="justify">
    The Facebook and Cambridge Analytica incident shows how the abuse of sensitive data
      can harm business notorieties and trust, so businesses need to question themselves is it
      really worth taking the risk or if going with compliant data is a more rational choice.
      Adopting Data protection and privacy policies ensures the enforcement of compliance
      with mandatory regulatory, internal compliance, legal and ethical requirements along
      with the need for managing risks. Personal information security can be classified into three parts, specifying clearly the information usage & providing access controls, setting
      up privacy monitoring units & incident management panels in the organization, and
      creating privacy awareness among the consumers/users.
      Businesses must abide by state and federal laws of their respective nations such as the
      ‘General Protection Regulation’ (GDPR) in the European Union, ‘The Bureau of Indian
      Standards’ (BIS) & Information Technology Act in India, California Consumers Privacy
      Act (CCPA) in the US and other respective nations laws which gives people more
      control over the personal data that business accumulates about them. Also, these
      regulations provide supervision on the implementation of the laws.</p> 
      
    <p align="justify"><h3>In the final analysis, </h3>
      Safeguarding data today is a full-time job today the very least. Security practices that
      are effective one day can be outdated the next, ensuring both updated physical and
      digital infrastructures is foremost necessary. While moral utilization of data is a
      regular effort, realizing that personal data subjects’ safety and rights are flawless is
      worth of work. Seeing privacy from the point of view of ethics can help businesses lay
      out and work on their code of conduct. Also, allows organizations to make meaningful
      decisions and grow in the competitive world.</p>
