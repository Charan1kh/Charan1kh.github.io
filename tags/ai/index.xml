      <description>In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we present a robust deep learning pipeline that is capable of identifying correct and incorrect mask-wearing from realtime video streams. To accomplish this goal, there are two prominent separate approaches available, evaluating their performance and run-time efficiency can be considered for real-world Usages. The first approach leverages a pretrained face detector in combination with a mask-wearing image classifier trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset.</description>

      <description>Deepfake Creation and Detection Using Cycle GANs Deep learning has been successfully applied to a variety of complex problems, ranging from big data analytics to computer vision and human-level control, using Cycle GANs. However, advances in deep learning have also been used to develop software that can cause threats to privacy, democracy, and national security. Deepfake is a popular technique based on artificial intelligence for image synthesis. As it can produce images without paired training data, it is more powerful than traditional image-to-image translation.</description>
