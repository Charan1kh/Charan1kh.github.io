      <description>Deepfake Creation and Detection Using Cycle GANs Deep learning has been successfully applied to a variety of complex problems, ranging from big data analytics to computer vision and human-level control, using Cycle GANs. However, advances in deep learning have also been used to develop software that can cause threats to privacy, democracy, and national security. Deepfake is a popular technique based on artificial intelligence for image synthesis. As it can produce images without paired training data, it is more powerful than traditional image-to-image translation.</description>
